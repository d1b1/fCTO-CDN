#### Github CDN Service
This is an experiment to see how much I can use the Github Service. I host cost, pages etc on github. So why not turn into my file storage for static content. Since github support customer domain names, I decided to see if I could keep things simple, and wrap the commits from a public repo in a CDN proxy.

Uses the Twic.pics

Each project has its own subdomain on Twic.pics. And each folder has is own reference. This work is use for my less-code search engine of no-code and low-code solutions for startups.

#### Next Up
I am a cheap and lazy developer. I love doing less (an getting paid) and I hate paying to stuff. So Twic.pic offers a frew proxy service. I would love to have a nice clean (personal domain) url. Like. https://cdn.less-code.stephansmith.solutions. But for now, I am too cheap to upgrade to the Twic.pic paid level. I know. Bad
